The key to solving this type of issue is to examine the complete webpack output for more details.  Expo's build process usually provides verbose logs; look for error messages beyond the initial, generic one.  Often, there are clues within the log about missing modules or build inconsistencies.

**Steps to Debug:**

1. **Enable verbose logging:** Run `expo prebuild --verbose` to see more detailed build output.  This should provide more specific error messages from the webpack bundler. 
2. **Check native module compatibility:** If the project involves native modules (e.g., through libraries like react-native-camera), verify that the versions of these modules are compatible with each other and with your Expo SDK version. Ensure your Expo SDK version is compatible with the target Android and iOS versions.
3. **Dependency review:** Examine your `package.json` file, checking the versions of all dependencies. Look for conflicting versions or known issues related to those dependencies.
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes a simple clean and rebuild can resolve temporary issues: `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo start`
5. **Simulator/Emulator:** If you're using a simulator or emulator, ensure that it's updated and compatible with the project's dependencies.
6. **Examine the complete webpack log:** This step involves inspecting the complete log of the build process, searching carefully for error messages beyond the initial error summary. The actual cause of the failure may be hidden deeper within the log.

**Example (Illustrative):**

Let's imagine the root cause is an incompatibility between `react-native-camera` and another library.  Webpack might show a generic error, but the verbose logs reveal an import conflict. The solution would then involve either resolving the conflict by updating or changing a dependency version or using a different approach.
