# Expo CLI: Obscure Webpack Bundling Errors

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the Expo CLI's webpack bundler produces an unclear error message, masking an underlying issue with native module compatibility.  The actual error might be buried deep within the webpack logs and difficult to track down.

## Bug Description

When building an Expo project, a generic webpack error occurs. This error isn't explicitly informative, making it challenging to identify the root cause (which, in this case, is a native module conflict).

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the complete webpack output, looking for more specific error messages within the verbose logs.  Additional steps include checking for version compatibility across all project dependencies, especially those relying on native modules.
