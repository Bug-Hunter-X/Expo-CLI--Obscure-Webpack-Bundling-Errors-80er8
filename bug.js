This error typically occurs when you're using the Expo CLI and encounter issues related to the bundling process, specifically when webpack encounters an unexpected error during the build.  The error message itself might not be extremely descriptive, often showing a generic message about a failed build or a missing module, even though the root cause might be something else entirely.

Here's an example scenario. Let's say you're using a library that relies on native modules, and there's a mismatch in the native module version or platform compatibility. Webpack might throw a generic error during the bundling phase, not explicitly stating the native module incompatibility.
